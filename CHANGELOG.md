# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: Apache-2.0 licence, `pyproject.toml` (uv, Python 3.13+, ruff, pyright
  strict, pytest), README, project conventions in `CLAUDE.md`, and a CLI stub that exits non-zero
  on every unimplemented command rather than implying it worked.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — full architecture specification, reviewed across five adversarial passes
  (49 findings resolved: 8 high, 27 medium, 14 low). Covers the KB directory format, SQLite schema,
  two-phase sync semantics, WAL concurrency policy, budget accounting by pre-call reservation,
  cross-KB linking via ULID-addressed sidecars, and the v0.1–v0.5 delivery plan.

Nothing is released yet — no functionality exists, so this stays unreleased until the v0.1 vertical
slice (`init` / `sync` / `search` / MCP server / eval harness) is usable end to end.
