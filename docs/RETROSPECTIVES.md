# Retrospectives

One section per increment of [`plans/v0.1.md`](../plans/v0.1.md), written during that increment's
retrospective review (the workflow is in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)). Only findings worth keeping
land here: a real defect the review caught, or a fact that would be expensive to rediscover. Fixes
themselves live in the commits; this file records *what was learned*.

Severity follows the design review's scale: **HIGH** — wrong behaviour or false confidence;
**MEDIUM** — would block or mislead; **LOW** — worth remembering, not urgent.

## I1 — Package skeleton, errors, CLI dispatch (20260725)

**MEDIUM — `PinakesError` could not be pickled, so an error crossing a process boundary raised
`TypeError` instead of reporting itself.** `Exception.__reduce__` replays `self.args` through
`type(self)`, but every subclass here takes its own constructor arguments (`NotImplementedYetError`
takes a command name and an increment), so rebuilding blew up on the missing `remedy` keyword.
Confirmed by probe before fixing, not reasoned about. Fixed with an explicit `__reduce__` routing
through a module-level helper. *Lesson: an exception class with a non-`(message,)` constructor is
unpicklable by default — the failure only surfaces under xdist/multiprocessing, i.e. exactly when
something else has already gone wrong.*

**MEDIUM — the subcommand dispatch target sat on the public namespace attribute `run`.** Any future
command declaring `--run` would have silently overwritten the function `main()` then calls. Moved to
a reserved `_runner` dest with a test asserting no public namespace attribute is ever callable.
*Lesson: `set_defaults` shares one namespace with every option; anything the framework itself
dispatches on must be underscore-reserved.*

**LOW (reference) — measured `ty` 0.0.63 against `pyright` strict on a 6-defect probe.** pyright
caught 6/6; ty caught 1/6 (the `str | None` → `len` error, with better diagnostics); ruff caught the
unused import. ty currently has no strict mode: it accepts unannotated defs and `Any` leakage, which
is precisely what `pyright` strict is in this project for. Decision (user): keep pyright as the gate,
add `uv run ty check` as a fast pre-check. *Worth re-measuring when ty leaves beta — the gap is a
missing feature, not a design difference.*
